# ============================================================
# Lifetime Report — copy everything below this line into Claude
# ============================================================

Produce a full lifetime report on this repo: the arc of every project,
stage, spec, decision, and release since the first commit. Not a status
snapshot (`just status` already does that) — a narrative of how the tool
got from nothing to where it is now. Use the pre-loaded data below;
read the project briefs and CHANGELOG for the "why" behind each wave.

Head the report with `# <Repo> — Lifetime Report` and, directly under it, a
`Generated: <date>` line — use the `Generated:` date given in the context block
below the prompt (this is the date the report was produced; the git-span and
project dates below are the history it covers, which is a different thing).

Structure to produce:
  1. What this is — one paragraph on the product and the lifecycle model.
  2. Lifetime at a glance — a metrics table (lifespan, #projects, #stages,
     #specs shipped/deferred, #decisions, #releases, open low-confidence debt).
  3. Release timeline — version / date / theme / which project shipped it.
  4. The waves — one tight paragraph per project: dates, stage/spec counts,
     what it delivered, and WHY now (pull from each brief's "Why Now").
  5. Arc of the whole thing — the progression across waves in one line,
     plus how each wave made the next cheap.
  6. Decision debt & loose ends — low-confidence DECs, deferred/cut specs,
     stale flags.
  7. What's next — the next unframed wave (see docs/roadmap/ if present).

Keep it skimmable: tables where the data is tabular, prose only for the arc.
