## Report to produce

1. Stale decisions — DEC-* that should be superseded given recent learning.
   Flag with reasoning; don't supersede yet.

2. Missing constraints — patterns in reflections or PRs that should be
   formalized as constraints. Propose specific YAML entries.

3. Resolved questions — items in questions.yaml that recent work has
   answered. Flag which DEC-* would formalize each.

4. AGENTS.md drift — anything in the repo contradicting AGENTS.md.
   Propose specific edits.

5. Template improvements — friction visible in reflections. Be specific:
   "add field X to projects/_templates/spec.md because Y."

6. Stage health — active stages progressing? Any stalled? Any to rescope?

7. Cycle health — are any cycles consistently skipped or painful? Is Frame
   used as a kill gate? Are reflections getting mailed in?

8. (claude-only variant only) Session hygiene — any signs that build and
   verify are happening in the same Claude session? Reflections that
   consistently say "nothing was unclear" are a warning sign.

Tight report. Actionable in 10 minutes.
