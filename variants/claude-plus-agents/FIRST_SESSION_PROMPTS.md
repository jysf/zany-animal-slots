## Prompt 1a — PROJECT FRAME

> **Use when:** Starting a new project (wave of work) in this repo.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 5 min.

```
I want to frame a potential project before committing to it.

A "project" in this repo is a wave of work. Prior projects:
[REPLACE: list any prior projects or say "none, this is the first"]

My raw idea for this project: [REPLACE: 1-3 sentences]

Produce a one-paragraph frame with exactly four elements:
- What: what this wave of work delivers
- For: who the user is
- Why now: what makes this the right wave, now
- Success: one concrete outcome that would mean it worked

Your task:
1. Ask clarifying questions. Be skeptical — it's cheaper to kill a
   project here than after design.
2. Produce the one-paragraph frame.
3. Give a go/kill recommendation with one sentence of reasoning.
4. Suggest a short-slug name for the project directory
   (e.g., "mvp", "improvements-q2", "redesign").

If the idea isn't ready, say "kill" and explain.
```

---

## Prompt 1b — PROJECT BRIEF

> **Use when:** Project frame approved. Producing the full brief.md.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 15 min.

```
Project frame approved. Produce the full brief.md.

Read these first:
- /README.md
- /AGENTS.md (especially the Work Hierarchy section)
- /.repo-context.yaml
- /projects/_templates/project-brief.md
- /projects/PROJ-001-example-mvp/brief.md (delete later)
- Any existing shipped projects in /projects/*/brief.md for continuity

Project frame (from Prompt 1a):
[REPLACE: paste frame]

Your task:

1. Determine the next PROJ-ID. If this is the first real project,
   use PROJ-001. Otherwise find the highest existing ID and increment.

2. Ask clarifying questions, especially:
   - What's the target ship date?
   - What stages do you anticipate? (3-5 typical)
   - Dependencies on prior projects?

3. Create the project directory:
   projects/PROJ-NNN-<slug>/
     ├── brief.md
     ├── stages/
     ├── specs/
     │   └── done/
     └── handoffs/

4. Populate brief.md from the template, including:
   - "What This Project Is" paragraph
   - "Why Now" justification
   - Success criteria (3-5 concrete)
   - Scope (in/out)
   - Stage Plan (2-5 stages, ordered, one-line summary each)
   - Dependencies
   - `value:` block in front-matter: thesis (one sentence,
     testable claim), beneficiaries (2-4), success_signals (3-5
     observable outcomes), risks_to_thesis (2-4 honest things
     that could make the thesis wrong). Be specific. "Users
     will love it" is not a thesis; "reducing month-2 churn by
     making activation faster" is.

5. If there's an example project folder
   (projects/PROJ-001-example-mvp/), propose deleting it.

Stop and let me review before we frame the first stage.
```

---

## Prompt 1c — STAGE FRAME

> **Use when:** Starting a new stage within the active project.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 15 min.

```
I want to frame a new stage in the active project.

Read first:
- /AGENTS.md
- /projects/<active-project>/brief.md
- /projects/_templates/stage.md
- Any already-shipped or in-progress stages in the active project
- Any relevant /decisions/DEC-*.md files

I already ran `just new-stage "<title>"` which created the stage file
with IDs filled in. The file is at:
[REPLACE: paste path, e.g. projects/PROJ-001-mvp/stages/STAGE-001-foundational-infra.md]

The stage I want to define:
- Title: [REPLACE]
- Why this stage is next: [REPLACE]
- Dependencies I know of: [REPLACE or "unknown"]

Your task:

1. Ask clarifying questions. Focus on: what does "done" mean for this
   stage? What does it unblock? What would cause you to split it?

2. Populate the stage file from the template:
   - "What This Stage Is" paragraph
   - "Why Now"
   - Success criteria (3-5)
   - Scope (in/out)
   - Proposed Spec Backlog (3-8 specs, ordered, each with S/M/L)
   - Design Notes (patterns across specs)
   - Dependencies
   - `value_contribution:` block in front-matter: advances
     (which part of the project's value.thesis this stage
     advances), delivers (user-visible capabilities when done),
     explicitly_does_not (what this stage is NOT trying to do —
     those are other stages' jobs). If you can't articulate
     value_contribution, the stage may be infrastructure-only —
     acceptable but flag it.

3. Flag any backlog entry that looks like complexity L — these should
   be split before building.

4. If the stage feels thin (under 3 specs) or sprawling (over 8),
   recommend rescoping.

Stop and let me review before any specs.
```

---

## Prompt 1d — STAGE SHIP

> **Use when:** All specs in a stage have shipped.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 15-20 min.

```
STAGE-NNN is ready to ship. All its specs are in /projects/<active-project>/specs/done/.

Read:
- /projects/<active-project>/stages/STAGE-NNN-<slug>.md
- Every spec in done/ that belongs to this stage (check
  project.stage: STAGE-NNN in front-matter)
- Their Reflection sections especially

Your task:

1. Check the stage's "Success Criteria" against what actually shipped.
   Did we deliver the outcome?

2. Review shipped specs against the stage's `value_contribution`.
   Flag any spec whose `value_link` didn't actually deliver what it
   claimed.

3. Summarize in 3 sentences:
   - Built vs planned
   - Took longer or easier than expected
   - Emergent integration behavior

4. Propose answers for the stage-level reflection fields (## Stage-Level
   Reflection section in the stage file).

5. Set the stage front-matter to reflect shipping:
   - `stage.status: shipped`
   - `shipped_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>` (today)
   This is how `just roadmap` will render this stage as completed.

6. Flag follow-up work: should any of it become a new stage in the
   current project? A spec in the NEXT stage? Deferred to a future
   project?

7. Propose updates to /AGENTS.md, /guidance/constraints.yaml, or any
   template based on patterns across shipped specs.

I'll review your proposals and write them into the stage file myself.
```

---

## Prompt 1e — PROJECT SHIP

> **Use when:** All stages in a project have shipped.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 20-30 min.

```
PROJ-NNN is ready to ship. All its stages are shipped.

Read:
- /projects/PROJ-NNN-<slug>/brief.md
- Every stage in that project
- Every shipped spec in that project
- Their Reflection sections
- /decisions/DEC-* emitted during this project (most recent N)

Your task:

1. Check the project's "Success Criteria" against what actually
   shipped. Did the wave of work deliver its intended outcome?

2. Cross-check shipped stages' `value_contribution` against the
   project's `value.thesis`. Did the thesis hold? Would you refine
   it based on what shipped?

3. Summarize in 3-5 sentences:
   - Scope evolution (what changed between brief and reality)
   - Stages that went smoothly vs painfully
   - Any major decisions that were superseded mid-project

4. Propose answers for the project-level reflection (## Project-Level
   Reflection section in the brief).

5. Identify deferred work: what came up during this project that
   should become input to the NEXT project's frame?

6. Recommend: should the active project folder be marked shipped
   (status: shipped) and a new project started, or is there more
   work that should extend into a "PROJ-NNN phase 2"?

7. Propose updates to /AGENTS.md, /guidance/*, or templates.

I'll review and write the proposals into the brief.
```

---

## Prompt 2a — REPO/PROJECT DESIGN

> **Use when:** Project brief + first stage approved; ready to architect.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 60-90 min.

```
Project brief and first stage are approved. Moving to repo-level design.

Read:
1. /README.md
2. /AGENTS.md
3. /.repo-context.yaml
4. /guidance/constraints.yaml
5. /decisions/DEC-001-example-structured-logging.md (format reference)
6. /decisions/_template.md
7. /projects/_templates/spec.md
8. /projects/_templates/handoff.md
9. /projects/<active-project>/brief.md
10. /projects/<active-project>/stages/<first-stage>.md

Project frame / brief summary: already populated; read from files above.

Additional hard constraints:
- Tech choices forced on us: [REPLACE or "none"]
- Timeline: [REPLACE]
- Compliance: [REPLACE or "none"]
- Explicit non-goals: [REPLACE]

Your task:

1. Ask clarifying questions on ambiguities in the architecture space.

2. Populate repo-level docs:
   - /docs/architecture.md (with Mermaid diagram)
   - /docs/data-model.md (or delete if not applicable)
   - /docs/api-contract.md (or delete if not applicable)

3. For every meaningful decision, create
   /decisions/DEC-NNN-<slug>.md using the template. Honest confidence
   values. Use the active project's ID as the origin project.

4. Update /guidance/constraints.yaml with rules derived from your
   decisions. Remove example constraints that don't apply.

5. Update /.repo-context.yaml with real stack values.

6. Update /AGENTS.md with the real tech stack, exact commands,
   conventions, domain glossary.

7. Delete the example files (or keep if they're still relevant):
   - /decisions/DEC-001-example-structured-logging.md
   - /projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-001-example-project-logger.md
     (if still present)
   - /projects/<active-project>/handoffs/HANDOFF-001-example-project-logger.md
     (if still present)

8. Cross-check the first stage's backlog against the architecture
   you just designed. Propose updates to the stage backlog if needed.

Stop after step 8 and let me review.
```

## Prompt 2b — SPEC DESIGN

> **Use when:** Ready to write one specific spec from a stage's backlog.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 15-30 min.

```
Please write the content of SPEC-NNN for the task
"[REPLACE: task title]" from STAGE-MMM's backlog.

I already ran `just new-spec "<title>" STAGE-MMM` which created the
spec file with IDs filled in:
[REPLACE: paste path]

Cycle starts at "design". Set to "build" after you also create the
handoff.

Read first:
- /AGENTS.md
- /projects/<active-project>/brief.md
- /projects/<active-project>/stages/STAGE-MMM-<slug>.md
- /docs/architecture.md
- /docs/data-model.md and /docs/api-contract.md (if applicable)
- /guidance/constraints.yaml
- All /decisions/DEC-*.md relevant to this task
- Any related specs (check stage backlog for shipped specs)

When writing the spec:
- Target complexity S or M. If L, split into multiple specs first.
- Acceptance criteria must be testable.
- Failing tests must be concrete: file paths + what each asserts.
- List applicable decisions and constraints in front-matter references.
- If you make NEW decisions while writing, emit
  /decisions/DEC-NNN-<slug>.md files for each.
- Populate `value_link:` at the bottom of front-matter. One
  sentence on what this spec contributes to its stage's
  value_contribution. If the spec is infrastructure with no
  direct user-visible contribution, write "infrastructure
  enabling STAGE-XXX's <capability>". Leave null only if
  genuinely unknown.

Then create the handoff file at
/projects/<active-project>/handoffs/HANDOFF-NNN-<slug>.md pointing
the implementer at the spec. The handoff's "Context the Receiving
Agent Needs" section is critical.

Finally, run `just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN build` (or update
task.cycle to "build" manually) and update the stage's Spec Backlog
section to reflect the new spec ID.

Before you stop, append a design cost session entry to
`cost.sessions`. If you're in Claude Code, run `/cost` first and
use its numbers. On Claude.ai web, set `interface: claude-ai` and
null the numeric fields (or best-guess). If your agent doesn't
report cost, null fields + a notes line.

  - cycle: design
    agent: <your model, e.g. claude-opus-4-7>
    interface: <claude-code | claude-ai | api | ollama | other>
    tokens_input: <from usage if known, else null>
    tokens_output: <same>
    estimated_usd: <best available, or null>
    duration_minutes: <estimate>
    recorded_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    notes: <one line if unusual, else null>

Scaffold the cycle timeline. Write the build prompt to
  projects/<active-project>/specs/prompts/SPEC-NNN-build.md
Base it on Prompt 3 below with SPEC-NNN, HANDOFF-NNN, and paths
substituted. The implementer will read this file (alongside the
handoff) to run the cycle.

Then replace the placeholder block in
  projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md
with:

  ## Instructions

  - [x] **design** — completed <YYYY-MM-DD>
  - [ ] **build** — prompt: `prompts/SPEC-NNN-build.md`
  - [ ] **verify** — prompt: pending (waiting on build)
  - [ ] **ship** — prompt: pending (waiting on verify)

Markers: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` complete
· `[?]` blocked (one-line reason, needs human or external unblock).

Stop and let me review before I hand off to the implementer.
```

---

## Prompt 3 — BUILD

> **Use when:** Spec + handoff ready; running the implementer.
> **Agent:** Your implementer (Kilo / Factory / AdaL / etc.).
> **Time:** Task-dependent.

```
You're the implementer for a spec-driven workflow. Cycle: build.

Read files in order, before writing code:

1. /AGENTS.md — conventions you must follow.
2. /projects/<active-project>/handoffs/HANDOFF-NNN-<slug>.md — your
   handoff. Follow its "Context the Receiving Agent Needs" section
   exactly.
3. /projects/<active-project>/brief.md — the project context.
4. /projects/<active-project>/stages/STAGE-MMM-<slug>.md — the stage.
5. Every decision listed in the handoff's references.
6. /guidance/constraints.yaml — constraints for paths you'll touch.
7. /projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>.md — the spec.

Before coding, mark the build cycle `[~]` in
  projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md
so anyone checking can see this cycle is live. If you hit something
that needs architect judgment or an external unblock (constraint
unclear, dependency missing, scope drift), change it to `[?]` with
a one-line reason and stop. `[?]` is NOT a dumping ground for "I
don't know what to do" — ask first if unsure.

Implement:
- Make the failing tests pass.
- Don't violate constraints. If one needs breaking, STOP and ask.
- For non-trivial decisions (library, pattern, API shape), create
  /decisions/DEC-NNN-<slug>.md files. Use honest confidence values.
- If the spec is ambiguous, STOP and ask. Don't guess.

When done:
1. Fill in the handoff's "Completion" section INCLUDING the three
   implementer reflection questions. Not optional.
2. Update handoff.status → "completed".
3. Append a build cost session entry to the spec's `cost.sessions`:

     - cycle: build
       agent: <your model>
       interface: <claude-code | claude-ai | api | ollama | other>
       tokens_input: <best available>
       tokens_output: <best available>
       estimated_usd: <best available>
       duration_minutes: <estimate>
       recorded_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
       notes: <one line if rework or unusual, else null>

   In Claude Code: run `/cost`, use its numbers. API: use the
   `usage` object. Claude.ai web: best-guess. Agent that doesn't
   report: null fields + `notes: "agent does not report cost"`.
4. Run: just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN verify
5. Open PR from feat/spec-NNN-<slug>.
6. PR description references: project ID, stage ID, spec ID, handoff
   ID, decisions used, constraints checked, new DEC-* files.
7. Mark build `[x]` in the timeline with PR number, cost, and date:
     - [x] **build** — prompt: `prompts/SPEC-NNN-build.md`
            PR #NNN, $X.XX, completed <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

---

## Prompt 4 — VERIFY

> **Use when:** Implementer opens a PR.
> **Agent:** Claude (reviewer).
> **Time:** 10-30 min.

```
Cycle: verify. Implementer completed SPEC-NNN.

Before reading, mark verify `[~]` in
  projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md

Review the PR: [REPLACE: paste PR link or full diff]

Read against:
- /projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>.md (acceptance
  criteria met? tests pass?)
- /projects/<active-project>/handoffs/HANDOFF-NNN-<slug>.md
  (deliverables, return criteria, reflection answered?)
- /projects/<active-project>/stages/STAGE-MMM-<slug>.md (does this
  advance the stage as intended?)
- Decisions in handoff references (drift? superseding DEC-*?)
- /guidance/constraints.yaml (violations?)

Flag:
- Untested acceptance criteria
- Decision drift without supersession
- Constraint violations
- Non-trivial choices missing DEC-*
- Mailed-in reflection ("nothing was unclear" is suspicious)
- Any decisions referenced at confidence < 0.6 (yellow flag)
- Follow-up specs this PR implies
- **Missing cost data:** `cost.sessions` lacks entries for prior
  cycles (design, build). Flag so missing agents can fill in
  retroactively. Do not block the PR for this.

Before returning your verdict, append your own verify cost session
entry to the spec's `cost.sessions` (same format as Design, but
`cycle: verify`).

Output exactly ONE of:

✅ APPROVED — merge at commit <SHA>. No changes needed.

⚠ PUNCH LIST:
   1. [specific item]
   2. [specific item]
   (Don't rewrite the code yourself. List what should change.)

❌ REJECTED because [fundamental reason].
   Recommended: [revise spec | split | revisit design].

If ✅ APPROVED: write the ship prompt to
  projects/<active-project>/specs/prompts/SPEC-NNN-ship.md
(base on Prompt 5 below with IDs/paths substituted), then mark
verify `[x]` in the timeline with the approved SHA, and add the
ship line referencing `prompts/SPEC-NNN-ship.md`.

If ⚠ or ❌: leave verify `[~]` if the implementer needs to rework
in the same cycle, or mark `[?]` with a one-line reason if architect
judgment is required (e.g. "acceptance criteria ambiguous, re-design
needed").
```

---

## Prompt 5 — SHIP

> **Use when:** PR approved.
> **Agent:** Human + light agent.
> **Time:** 5-10 min.

```
Cycle: ship. PR for SPEC-NNN is approved.

Pre-ship checklist:
[ ] CI passing?
[ ] Deployment steps known?
[ ] Rollback plan?
[ ] CHANGELOG or release note?

After merge + deploy, help me answer three reflection questions.
Append as a "## Reflection" block at the bottom of the spec:

1. What would I do differently next time?
   [REPLACE: your answer]

2. Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?
   [REPLACE: your answer — call out specifically so I can update now]

3. Is there a follow-up spec I should write before I forget?
   [REPLACE: your answer — if yes, one-line summary]

Before starting, mark ship `[~]` in
  projects/<active-project>/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md

After I paste answers:
- Format as ## Reflection block in the spec
- Append a ship cost session entry to `cost.sessions` (same format
  as Design, `cycle: ship`).
- Compute `cost.totals` from the session entries:
  * `tokens_total` = sum(tokens_input + tokens_output) across
    sessions, skipping nulls
  * `estimated_usd` = sum(estimated_usd) skipping nulls
  * `session_count` = len(sessions) (include sessions with null
    numeric fields)
  If any session had nulls, that's fine — reports will show
  "partial cost data available" rather than missing.
- Mark ship `[x]` in the timeline with merge date + total cost.
- Run: just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN ship
- Run: just archive-spec SPEC-NNN  (also moves timeline into done/)
- If I mentioned a template/constraint/decision update, propose the
  specific edit.
- If I mentioned a follow-up spec, add to the stage's backlog.
- Update the parent STAGE's backlog (mark shipped).

If this was the LAST spec in STAGE-MMM's backlog, remind me to run
Prompt 1d (Stage Ship) next.
```

## Prompt 6 — WEEKLY REVIEW

> **Use when:** Weekly, or every 5-10 specs.
> **Agent:** Claude (architect).
> **Time:** 20-30 min.
>
> **Shortcut:** `just weekly-review` pre-loads context — paste its output
> into Claude as the prompt body.

```
Weekly review of the repository.

Read:
- All /decisions/DEC-*.md (repo-level, across projects)
- /guidance/constraints.yaml
- /guidance/questions.yaml
- /AGENTS.md
- /projects/<active-project>/brief.md
- All stages in the active project
- Reflection sections of recent specs in specs/done/

Produce a short report covering:

1. Stale decisions — DEC-* that should be superseded given recent
   learning. Flag with reasoning; don't supersede yet.

2. Low-confidence decisions — any DEC at confidence < 0.8 where
   recent work has strengthened or weakened the underlying bet.

3. Missing constraints — patterns in reflections or PRs that should
   be formalized. Propose specific YAML entries.

4. Resolved questions — items in questions.yaml that recent work
   has answered. Flag which DEC would formalize each.

5. AGENTS.md drift — repo behavior contradicting AGENTS.md. Propose
   specific edits.

6. Template improvements — friction visible in reflections. Specific:
   "add field X to /projects/_templates/spec.md because Y."

7. Stage health — active stage progressing? Stalled? Rescope needed?

8. Cycle health — any cycles consistently skipped or painful?
   Is Frame used as a kill gate? Reflections getting mailed in?

9. Project health — is the active project still well-scoped?
   Scope creep? Time to declare done and start PROJ-NN+1?

10. Value linkage — report on `value_link` population rate across
    active specs. Specs without `value_link` aren't a problem per
    se, but a trend toward never populating them means the thesis
    isn't driving spec selection.

11. Cost review — aggregate `cost.totals.estimated_usd` across
    specs shipped this week. Outliers? Patterns (design-heavy vs
    build-heavy)? Specs missing cost data entirely? The last one
    is an agent-discipline signal worth flagging.

Tight report. Actionable in 10 minutes.
```
