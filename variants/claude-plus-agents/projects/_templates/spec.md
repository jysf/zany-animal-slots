# SPEC-XXX: <Short Title>

## Context

Why does this spec exist? What problem does it solve? Link to:
- The parent `STAGE-XXX` and this spec's place in its backlog
- The project `PROJ-XXX`
- Any related discussions, issues, or prior decisions

## Goal

1–2 sentences. Unambiguous. If you can't write the goal in two
sentences, split the spec.

## Inputs

What the implementer will read or consume.

- **Files to read:** `path/to/file.ext` — why
- **External APIs:** <name, docs link, auth requirements>
- **Related code paths:** `src/some/module/`

## Outputs

What the implementer will produce.

- **Files created:** `path/to/new.ext` — purpose
- **Files modified:** `path/to/existing.ext` — what changes
- **New endpoints / functions / components:** <names and signatures>
- **Database changes:** <migrations, if any>

## Acceptance Criteria

Testable outcomes. Each must map to at least one test. Cover happy
path, error cases, edge cases.

- [ ] Criterion 1 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (testable)

## Failing Tests

Written during the **design** cycle, BEFORE handoff. The implementer's
job in **build** is to make these pass.

- **`path/to/test.file`**
  - `"test description 1"` — asserts: ...
  - `"test description 2"` — asserts: ...

## Non-Goals

Explicit scope limits. If the implementer thinks any of these need to
happen, they should create a new spec (in this stage's backlog), not
expand this one.

- ...

## Notes for the Implementer

Gotchas, style preferences, reuse opportunities. Keep short — the full
context graph lives in the handoff file.

## Reflection

*Appended during **ship**. Three questions, short answers.*

1. **What would I do differently next time?**
   — <answer>

2. **Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?**
   — <answer>

3. **Is there a follow-up spec I should write now before I forget?**
   — <answer>
