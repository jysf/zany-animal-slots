## 1. Repo Overview

- **Repo (the app):** [REPLACE: My App]
- **Purpose:** [REPLACE: one sentence]
- **Primary stakeholders:** [REPLACE]
- **Active project:** [REPLACE: PROJ-001 — MVP]

See `.repo-context.yaml` for structured metadata.

## 2. Work Hierarchy

```
REPO (the app — persists across all projects)
 └─ PROJECT (a wave of work: "MVP", "improvements", "v2 redesign")
     └─ STAGE (a coherent chunk within a project)
         └─ SPEC (an individual task)
              └─ HANDOFF (architect → implementer delegation record)
```

Key distinctions:

- The **repo** is the app. It persists. `AGENTS.md`, `/docs/`, `/guidance/`,
  `/decisions/` live at repo level because they accumulate across all
  projects.
- A **project** (`/projects/PROJ-*/`) is a bounded wave of work. Project
  artifacts (brief, stages, specs, handoffs) live inside the project
  folder.
- A **stage** is an epic-sized chunk within a project. A project typically
  has 2–5 stages.
- A **spec** is a single implementable task. It belongs to exactly one
  stage within one project.
- A **handoff** is an architect-to-implementer delegation document.

**Decisions persist at repo level**, even though they're often made
during a specific project. A decision like "we use pino for logging"
was made during PROJ-001 but binds PROJ-002 and PROJ-003 too. This is
intentional.

**Specs do not cross project boundaries.** If a task isn't finished
when a project ships, either finish it first or defer it explicitly into
the next project's brief.

---

## 3. Business Value

Value structure exists at project and stage levels; specs link lightly.

**Project `value:` block** states the thesis — a testable claim about
what this wave of work delivers. Beneficiaries, success signals, and
risks to the thesis make it falsifiable, not marketing copy.

**Stage `value_contribution:` block** states what this coherent chunk
of work advances, what capabilities it delivers, and what it
explicitly doesn't try to do. Helps avoid stages that seem valuable
but don't contribute to the project thesis.

**Spec `value_link:`** is a one-sentence reference back to the
stage's value. Infrastructure specs may have
`value_link: "infrastructure enabling X"`. Optional but encouraged —
it surfaces specs that don't trace back to the thesis.

Reports (`just report-daily`, `just report-weekly`) aggregate these
signals: which stages advanced the thesis, which specs most directly
delivered it, and where value traceability broke down.

---

## 4. Cost Tracking Discipline

Every cycle on a spec appends a session entry to the spec's
`cost.sessions` list, with a **real** `tokens_total` for metered cycles —
so reports aggregate actual AI spend, not zeros. Documentation alone is
skippable, and cost tracking silently goes empty (all-null numerics) the
moment a prompt says "leave it null"; the rule below + `just cost-audit`
make it stick. Full reference: `docs/cost-tracking.md`.

- **Schema:** a single combined `tokens_total` per session (most harnesses
  report one number — `/cost` in Claude Code, the `usage` object from an
  API call, `subagent_tokens` in an `Agent` result). Do NOT split
  input/output; there is no reliable split.
- **build / verify cycles** are the metered ones and must NOT be left
  null. The agent that runs the cycle records the real `tokens_total` /
  `duration_minutes` / `estimated_usd` from its own interface — the
  implementer for **build** (Claude Code `/cost`, the API `usage` object,
  or whatever its tool reports), the reviewer for **verify**. Carry the
  build number across in the handoff if the implementer can't write the
  spec directly; whoever ships confirms the numbers are present.
- **design / ship cycles** are main-loop work with no clean per-cycle
  metering — leave numerics `null` with a "main-loop, not separately
  metered" note.
- **`estimated_usd`** = `tokens_total` × your model's published list rate,
  no cache discount — an order-of-magnitude estimate; say so in the note.
- **Interfaces:** set `interface:` to `claude-code` | `claude-ai`
  (estimate by length) | `api` (the `usage` object) | `ollama` | `other`.
  Only genuinely un-metered cycles may be null-with-note.

The cycle-prompt wording lives in
`projects/_templates/prompts/cost-snippet.md` — use it so prompts don't
re-introduce the "null numerics" loophole. **Ship computes `cost.totals`**
(sum of non-null sessions; `tokens_total` uses `0`, never `null`) and runs
`just cost-audit`, which **fails if any shipped spec lacks build/verify
cost** (constraint `cost-captured-per-cycle`; CI job `cost-data`; surfaced
in `just status` and `report-weekly`). Pre-process specs can be
grandfathered via `COST_AUDIT_GRANDFATHERED` in `scripts/_lib.sh` (empty
by default).

Reports aggregate cost by cycle, by interface, by spec, and by stage.

## 8. Cycle Model

Every spec moves through five cycles. **Cycles are tags, not gates** — edit any artifact anytime. The word "cycle" names what a spec goes through on its way to shipping.

| Cycle | Purpose | Who |
|---|---|---|
| **frame** | Go/no-go on the spec | Human + Claude (1 min) |
| **design** | Spec + failing tests + handoff | Claude (architect) |
| **build** | Make failing tests pass | Implementer agent |
| **verify** | Review + validation | Claude (reviewer) |
| **ship** | Merge, deploy, reflect, archive | Human + light agent |

Valid transitions:
```
frame → design → build → verify → ship
                   ↑       │
                   └───────┘ (verify sends back on punch list)
```

Projects and stages have lighter lifecycles (not full cycles):

- **Project status:** `proposed | active | shipped | cancelled`
- **Stage status:** `proposed | active | shipped | cancelled | on_hold`

A stage is `active` when its first spec enters design. `shipped` when
its spec backlog is complete AND the stage-level reflection is written.

---

## 9. Instruction Timeline

Every spec has a timeline file at
`projects/*/specs/SPEC-NNN-<slug>-timeline.md` listing cycle
instructions in order with status markers.

Status markers:

- `[ ]` not started — no one has picked this up yet
- `[~]` in progress — an executor is currently running this
- `[x]` complete — cycle finished; see the prompt file for what was run
- `[?]` blocked — needs a human decision or external unblock before
  proceeding. Include a one-line reason after the marker.

Cycle prompts live at `projects/*/specs/prompts/SPEC-NNN-<cycle>.md`.
The architect writes them; executors (the implementer agent for
build, Claude again for verify) read and run them.

**Discipline for executors:**

- When you start a cycle, mark it `[~]`.
- When you finish, mark it `[x]` with a one-line result (PR number,
  cost, completion date).
- If you hit a real blocker — constraint ambiguous, dependency
  missing, verify surfaced something needing architect judgment —
  mark `[?]` with a one-line reason. Do NOT use `[?]` as a "I don't
  know what to do" dumping ground. Blocked means the next move
  requires someone else; everything else is in-progress or a
  question to resolve in the current session.

This is a convention, not a mechanism. No tooling enforces it; the
discipline lives in the prompt set. Skip it and nothing breaks, but
you lose the history artifact and the next executor has to hunt for
the right prompt.

## 10. Cross-Reference Rules

Every spec has these relationships, encoded in front-matter:

- `project.id` → the project it belongs to (e.g., `PROJ-001`)
- `project.stage` → the stage within that project (e.g., `STAGE-002`)
- `references.decisions` → DEC-* it was designed against
- `references.constraints` → constraints that apply
- `handoff.from_agent` / `handoff.to_agent` → roles in the delegation

When a spec references a DEC, the DEC does not reciprocally list the
spec. DECs are stable repo-level records; specs come and go.

## 11. Coding Conventions

- **Naming:** [REPLACE]
- **File organization:** [REPLACE]
- **Imports:** [REPLACE]
- **Error handling:** [REPLACE]
- **Logging:** [REPLACE]
- **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*.
- **No dead code.** Delete, don't comment out.
- **Diagrams:** author them as Mermaid fenced blocks in markdown
  (`/docs/`, `/decisions/`, specs) so they render on GitHub and you can
  keep them current as part of the work. Update the relevant diagram in
  the same change, not afterward. See `/guidance/recommended-tools.md`.

---

## 12. Testing Conventions

- Every new function gets at least one test.
- Test file naming: [REPLACE]
- Coverage expectations: [REPLACE]
- Must test: happy path, error cases, edge cases from acceptance criteria.
- Need not test: third-party internals, framework behavior.
- **TDD:** Tests live in the spec's `## Failing Tests` section, written
  during **design**, made to pass during **build**.

## 13. Git and PR Conventions

- **Branch:** `feat/spec-NNN-<slug>`, `fix/spec-NNN-<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`
- **One spec per branch, one PR per branch.**
- **Commits:** [REPLACE: e.g., Conventional Commits]
- **PR description must include:**
  - Project: `PROJ-NNN`
  - Stage: `STAGE-NNN`
  - Spec: `SPEC-NNN`
  - Handoff: `HANDOFF-NNN`
  - Decisions referenced: `DEC-NNN, DEC-MMM`
  - Constraints checked: `[list]`
  - New `DEC-*` files created during build

**One git worktree per concurrent session.** This variant routinely has
two agents in flight (architect and implementer). If more than one session
touches this repo at once, each MUST run in its own `git worktree`, not the
shared checkout — two agents writing one working tree corrupt each other
(a parallel build can clobber an uncommitted edit, or a commit can land on
the wrong branch). `git worktree add <path> <branch>`, work there, commit +
push, then `git worktree remove`. Always check `git branch --show-current`
before any commit.

## 15. Cycle-Specific Agent Rules

### During **build** (implementer reads this)

Before writing code:
1. Read the `/projects/PROJ-*/handoffs/HANDOFF-*.md` for your spec.
2. Read the linked `SPEC-*.md`, `STAGE-*.md`, and the project's `brief.md`.
3. Read every `DEC-*` listed in the handoff's references.
4. Read `/guidance/constraints.yaml`; check rules for paths you'll touch.
5. If anything is ambiguous, add to `/guidance/questions.yaml` and stop.

When done:
1. Fill in the handoff's `## Completion` section (including reflection).
2. Update `handoff.status` → `completed`; update spec's `task.cycle` → `verify`.
3. Append a build cost session entry to the spec's `cost.sessions`.
4. Create `DEC-*` files for non-trivial implementer decisions. When a
   decision is tied to specific code, fill in its `affected_scope`
   with the path globs it governs (e.g. `src/lib/log.ts`,
   `src/api/**`). This is required for file-bound decisions — it's
   what lets `just decisions-audit --changed` surface the decision
   when those paths change later. Leave `affected_scope: []` only for
   decisions not tied to particular files (e.g. a process choice).
5. Open PR following Section 13.

Shortcut: `just advance-cycle SPEC-NNN verify`.

### During **verify** (reviewer reads this)

Check:
1. Acceptance criteria all met and tested?
2. Failing tests from spec now pass?
3. No drift from referenced decisions?
4. No constraint violations?
5. Non-trivial implementer choices have accompanying `DEC-*`?
6. Implementer reflection answered (not mailed in)?
7. `cost.sessions` has entries for prior cycles? Flag if missing
   (don't block).

For check 3, run `just decisions-audit --changed` — it flags which
`DEC-*` records govern the files the implementer touched, so you can
confirm the work stayed consistent with them. `just decisions-audit`
(no flag) lints the records themselves. See `/guidance/recommended-tools.md`
for optional, heavier verify tooling (e.g. LineSpec for protocol-level
integration tests).

Append a verify cost session entry before returning the verdict.

Output: ✅ APPROVED (with SHA) / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED.

### During **ship**

Append a `## Reflection` block to the spec with three answers:
1. What would I do differently next time?
2. Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?
3. Is there a follow-up spec to write now?

Then:
- Update the spec's `task.cycle` → `ship`.
- Append a ship cost session entry, then compute `cost.totals`.
- Run `just archive-spec SPEC-NNN` (moves to `done/`, updates stage).
- If stage backlog is complete, run the Stage Ship prompt.
- Commit.

---

## 16. Confidence Discipline

Decisions in `/decisions/` have an `insight.confidence` field (0.0–1.0).
Honest values matter — they drive these behaviors:

- **Design phase:** if Claude emits a decision at confidence < 0.7, it
  also adds an entry to `/guidance/questions.yaml` flagging it for
  further investigation.
- **Verify phase:** if a spec references any decision at confidence < 0.6,
  that's a yellow flag worth surfacing in the review.
- **Weekly review:** all decisions at confidence < 0.8 are listed with
  a note on whether recent work has strengthened or weakened them.

Use 1.0 only for decisions that are truly locked (tech stack choice
after it's been installed and working, for example). Most decisions
should land between 0.7 and 0.95.
