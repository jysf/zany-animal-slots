# SPEC-XXX: <Short Title>

## Context

Why does this spec exist? What problem does it solve? Link to:
- The parent `STAGE-XXX` and this spec's place in its backlog
- The project `PROJ-XXX`
- Any related discussions or prior decisions

## Goal

1–2 sentences. Unambiguous. If you can't write the goal in two
sentences, split the spec.

## Inputs

- **Files to read:** `path/to/file.ext` — why
- **External APIs:** <name, docs link, auth>
- **Related code paths:** `src/some/module/`

## Outputs

- **Files created:** `path/to/new.ext` — purpose
- **Files modified:** `path/to/existing.ext` — what changes
- **New exports:** <names and signatures>
- **Database changes:** <migrations>

## Acceptance Criteria

Testable outcomes. Cover happy path, error cases, edge cases.

- [ ] Criterion 1 (testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (testable)

## Failing Tests

Written during **design**, BEFORE build. The implementer's job in
**build** is to make these pass.

- **`path/to/test.file`**
  - `"test description 1"` — asserts: ...

## Implementation Context

*Read this section (and the files it points to) before starting
the build cycle. It is the equivalent of a handoff document, folded
into the spec since there is no separate receiving agent.*

### Decisions that apply

- `DEC-NNN` — <one-line summary of why this matters here>
- `DEC-MMM` — <one-line summary>

### Constraints that apply

These constraints apply to the paths touched by this task (see
`/guidance/constraints.yaml` for full text):

- `constraint-id-1` — <one-line summary>
- `constraint-id-2` — <one-line summary>

### Prior related work

- `SPEC-YYY` (shipped) — <one-line summary, if relevant>
- `PR #NNN` — <link, if relevant>

### Out of scope (for this spec specifically)

Explicit list of what this spec does NOT include. If any of these feel
necessary during build, create a new spec rather than expanding this one.

- ...

## Notes for the Implementer

Gotchas, style preferences, reuse opportunities.

## Build Completion

*Filled in at the end of the **build** cycle, before advancing to verify.*

- **Branch:**
- **PR (if applicable):**
- **All acceptance criteria met?** yes/no
- **New decisions emitted:**
  - `DEC-NNN` — <title> (if any)
- **Deviations from spec:**
  - [list]
- **Follow-up work identified:**
  - [any new specs for the stage's backlog]

### Build-phase reflection (3 questions, short answers)

Process-focused: how did the build go? What friction did the spec create?

1. **What was unclear in the spec that slowed you down?**
   — <answer>

2. **Was there a constraint or decision that should have been listed but wasn't?**
   — <answer>

3. **If you did this task again, what would you do differently?**
   — <answer>

---

## Reflection (Ship)

*Appended during the **ship** cycle. Outcome-focused reflection, distinct
from the process-focused build reflection above.*

1. **What would I do differently next time?**
   — <answer>

2. **Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?**
   — <answer>

3. **Is there a follow-up spec I should write now before I forget?**
   — <answer>
