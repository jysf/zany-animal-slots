**For a build or verify prompt** (the cycle runs as a metered subagent):

```
Append your cycle's entry to the spec front-matter `cost.sessions` with:
  - cycle: <build|verify>
    agent: <the model you ran as>
    interface: claude-code
    tokens_total: <leave null here>     # the ORCHESTRATOR fills the real number
    estimated_usd: <leave null here>    # from the Agent result at ship
    duration_minutes: <leave null here>
    recorded_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    notes: "<one line>"
Do NOT invent token numbers. The orchestrator records the real tokens_total /
duration / estimated_usd from your Agent result during ship bookkeeping.
(If you run this cycle interactively instead of as a subagent, run `/cost` and
write the real numbers here yourself.)
```

**For the orchestrator's ship bookkeeping** (this is where real numbers land):

```
For each metered cycle (build, verify), write the real values into cost.sessions:
  tokens_total    = the Agent result's subagent_tokens
  duration_minutes= round(duration_ms / 60000)
  estimated_usd   = tokens_total × your model's published list rate, no cache
                    discount; add a one-line note that it's an order-of-magnitude
                    estimate (the harness reports one combined token metric, no
                    I/O split).
Leave design/ship (orchestrator main-loop) numerics null with a
"main-loop, not separately metered" note.
Append the ship session itself with recorded_at: <today's date, i.e. the ship
date>. This is the field `just specs-by-stage` reads for the spec's ship date —
an active stage has no shipped_at to fall back on, so omitting it renders "—".
Every session should carry a recorded_at; `just cost-audit` FAILS if the ship
session lacks one.
Compute cost.totals: tokens_total = sum of non-null sessions (use 0, not null,
for the placeholder), estimated_usd = sum, session_count = number of cycles.
Then `just cost-audit` must pass before the spec is considered shipped.
```
