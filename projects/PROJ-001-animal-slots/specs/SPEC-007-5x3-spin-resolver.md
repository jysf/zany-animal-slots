# SPEC-007: 5×3 spin resolver

## Context

The third STAGE-002 engine spec. With the RNG (SPEC-005) and weighted strips
(SPEC-006) in place, this spec resolves a **spin** into the visible 5×3 grid:
draw one stop per reel from the injected PRNG (reel 0→4) and read the three
consecutive symbols at each stop. The grid it produces is the input that payline
evaluation (SPEC-008) and the UI reels (STAGE-003) consume. It owns the spin's
*shape* (grid + draw order); it does not score, bet, or classify.

See `STAGE-002-slot-engine.md`, the **Game-Design Spec** in `brief.md` (grid &
reel model + draw order), `DEC-002` (seedable injected RNG), and SPEC-006's
`STRIPS`/`visibleCells`.

## Goal

Given an injected `Rng` (and the reel `STRIPS`), draw one stop per reel in order
(reel 0→4) and resolve the visible 5×3 `Grid`. Same seed ⇒ same stops ⇒ same grid.

## Inputs

- **Files to read:** `src/engine/rng.ts` (`Rng`, `randomInt`), `src/engine/strips.ts`
  (`STRIPS`, `REEL_COUNT`, `visibleCells`, `SymbolId`); `brief.md` Game-Design Spec
  (grid/reel model + the reel 0→4 draw order).
- **Related code paths:** `src/engine/`.

## Outputs

- **Files created:**
  - `src/engine/spin.ts` — the resolver.
  - `src/engine/spin.test.ts` — the Failing Tests below.
- **New exports (from `spin.ts`):**
  - `export type Grid = SymbolId[][];` — indexed `grid[reel][row]`, 5 reels × 3
    rows (row 0 = top, 1 = mid, 2 = bottom). Documented with a comment.
  - `export function resolveStops(rng: Rng, strips?: readonly (readonly SymbolId[])[]):
    number[];` — one `randomInt(rng, strip.length)` per reel, in reel order 0→4;
    returns the five stop indices. Defaults to `STRIPS`.
  - `export function resolveGrid(rng: Rng, strips?: readonly (readonly SymbolId[])[]):
    Grid;` — the grid built from `resolveStops` + `visibleCells`. Defaults to `STRIPS`.
- **Database changes:** none.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `resolveStops(rng)` returns `REEL_COUNT` (5) integers, each in
      `[0, strip.length)`, drawn in reel order 0→4 — exactly one PRNG draw per reel.
- [ ] `resolveGrid(rng)` returns a 5×3 `Grid` (`grid[reel]` has 3 symbols), where
      `grid[reel]` equals `visibleCells(strips[reel], stops[reel])`.
- [ ] **Deterministic:** the same seed yields the same stops and the same grid.
- [ ] The resolver matches the **pinned** stops/grid for seed 12345 (locks the
      RNG↔strip↔grid pipeline end to end).
- [ ] `spin.ts` imports only engine modules (`rng`, `strips`) — no React/DOM/
      `src/ui`; no bare `Math.random()`.
- [ ] `just typecheck`, `just lint`, `just test`, `just build` all exit 0.

## Failing Tests

Written during **design**, BEFORE build. The pinned stops/grid were computed from
the canonical strip (SPEC-006) and the canonical RNG (SPEC-005).

- **`src/engine/spin.test.ts`**
  - `"resolveStops returns five in-range stops"` — for `createRng(7)`,
    `resolveStops(rng)` has length 5 and every value is an integer in `[0, 35)`.
  - `"resolveStops consumes exactly one draw per reel, in order"` — with two
    `createRng(5)` instances `a` and `b`: call `resolveStops(a)`, then advance `b`
    with five `b()` calls; assert `a() === b()` (proves resolveStops consumed
    exactly 5 draws, in sequence).
  - `"resolveStops is deterministic and matches the pinned seed"` — from
    `createRng(12345)`, `resolveStops(rng)` deep-equals `[34, 10, 16, 28, 17]`.
  - `"resolveGrid is 5 reels × 3 rows"` — `resolveGrid(createRng(7))` has length 5
    and each `grid[reel]` has length 3.
  - `"each grid column equals visibleCells at the drawn stop"` — with seed 5: get
    `stops = resolveStops(createRng(5))` and `grid = resolveGrid(createRng(5))`;
    for every reel, `grid[reel]` deep-equals `visibleCells(STRIPS[reel], stops[reel])`.
  - `"resolveGrid matches the pinned grid for seed 12345"` — `resolveGrid(createRng(12345))`
    deep-equals:
    ```
    [["FOX","DEER","FOX"],
     ["DEER","FOX","BEAR"],
     ["DEER","FOX","WOLF"],
     ["FOX","BEAR","EAGLE"],
     ["FOX","WOLF","SQUIRREL"]]
    ```
  - `"resolveGrid is deterministic"` — two `resolveGrid(createRng(99))` calls
    deep-equal each other.

## Implementation Context

### Decisions that apply

- `DEC-002` (seedable injected RNG) — the resolver takes an injected `Rng`; it
  never creates its own randomness and never calls `Math.random()`.
- `DEC-001` (engine/presentation separation) — pure engine; imports only `rng`
  and `strips`.

### Constraints that apply

- `deterministic-rng` (blocking) — all draws via the injected `Rng`/`randomInt`.
- `engine-no-dom` (blocking, lint-enforced), `test-before-implementation`,
  `one-spec-per-pr`.

### Prior related work

- `SPEC-005` (shipped, PR #5) — `rng.ts` (`Rng`, `randomInt`).
- `SPEC-006` (shipped, PR #6) — `strips.ts` (`STRIPS`, `REEL_COUNT`,
  `visibleCells`, `SymbolId`). The pinned grid in the tests is the canonical strip
  read at the seed-12345 stops `[34,10,16,28,17]`.

### Out of scope (for this spec specifically)

- Payline/paytable scoring (SPEC-008), bet/balance (SPEC-009), win-tier (SPEC-010),
  the composed public `spin()` (SPEC-011).
- Converting a seed to an `Rng` at the public boundary — `spin.ts` takes an `Rng`;
  the seed→`Rng` convenience lives in `index.ts` (SPEC-011).
- Any reel animation, timing, or rendering (STAGE-003).

## Notes for the Implementer

- `Grid` is `grid[reel][row]` (NOT row-major). `grid[reel] = visibleCells(strip,
  stop)` returns `[top, mid, bottom]`, so row 0 is top.
- Draw order is reel 0→4, exactly one `randomInt(rng, strip.length)` per reel — do
  not reorder or batch draws, or the pinned fixtures (and future seeds) break.
- `resolveGrid` should reuse `resolveStops` (don't draw twice). Suggested:
  `const stops = resolveStops(rng, strips); return stops.map((s, reel) =>
  visibleCells(strips[reel], s));`.
- Default the `strips` param to `STRIPS` so callers normally pass only the `Rng`.

## Build Completion

*Filled in at the end of the **build** cycle, before advancing to verify.*

- **Branch:** `feat/spec-007-spin-resolver`
- **PR (if applicable):** (pending verify)
- **All acceptance criteria met?** yes
- **New decisions emitted:**
  - none — implementation followed the spec exactly; no non-trivial decisions needed.
- **Deviations from spec:**
  - none
- **Follow-up work identified:**
  - none beyond the already-planned backlog (SPEC-008 paylines, etc.)

### Build-phase reflection (3 questions, short answers)

1. **What was unclear in the spec that slowed you down?**
   — Nothing material. The spec was unusually precise: exact function signatures,
     exact draw-order constraint, exact pinned stops + grid, and a worked-example
     verification step spelled out in the implementation notes. The `visibleCells`
     spread-to-`SymbolId[]` cast was the only minor gap (the return type is a tuple
     but `Grid` expects a plain array), resolved with `as SymbolId[]`.

2. **Was there a constraint or decision that should have been listed but wasn't?**
   — No. `DEC-001` (engine boundary) and `DEC-002` (injected RNG) fully cover
     what `spin.ts` needed. The `engine-no-dom` ESLint rule caught any stray imports
     automatically.

3. **If you did this task again, what would you do differently?**
   — Nothing significant. The spec's pinned-value approach (compute expected
     output externally, paste it into the test) is excellent — it nailed a subtle
     RNG interaction bug before any code existed. I'd use that pattern again.
